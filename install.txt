[WARNING] You are not setting Devise.secret_token within your application!
You must set this in config/initializers/devise.rb. Here's an example:
 
Devise.secret_token = "292acd43ba534a77c670eece57e7e98378a0e16d36474957a4313f1788b52f899bd11b465cf11865e87dbdc95b59c31e5d14"
[deprecated] I18n.enforce_available_locales will default to true in the future. If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set I18n.enforce_available_locales = false to avoid this message.
